======================================

When connecting from an application, always use a non-superuser. Patroni requires access to the database to function properly. By using a superuser from an application, you can potentially use the entire connection pool, including the connections reserved for superusers, with the ``superuser_reserved_connections`` setting. If Patroni cannot access the Primary because the connection pool is full, behavior will be undesirable.
